# Insight Data Engineering coding challenge - April 2017

No special libraries used.

Here are the requirements:
sys, os, collections, re, time, heapq, datetime

There is only one executable file:

process_log.py

Command to execute:

python ./src/process_log.py <Input File> <Hosts Output File> <Resources Output File> <Hours Output File> <Blocked Output File>

python ./src/process_log.py ./log_input/log.txt ./log_output/hosts.txt ./log_output/resources.txt ./log_output/hours.txt ./log_output/blocked.txt


It processes the entire input file. Features are implemented as methods named feature_1(), feature_2() etc for easy reference.

Thank you
